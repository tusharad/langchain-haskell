# langchain-hs Documentation

## Welcome to langchain-hs

Langchain-hs brings the power of LangChain to Haskell, enabling type-safe LLM application development with:

- Composable pipelines using Haskell's type system
- Closely following with Offical LangChain concepts
- Performance through functional programming patterns
- Support for Ollama, OpenAI, and custom LLM integrations

**Current Status** : Actively developed with expanding feature set. Check the Roadmap for upcoming features.
