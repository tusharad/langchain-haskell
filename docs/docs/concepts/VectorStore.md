# VectorStore
VectorStore is a typeclass that provides an interface for storing and retrieving vectors. It is used in Langchain to manage the storage and retrieval of embeddings generated by various models. The VectorStore typeclass defines methods for adding, searching, and deleting vectors from the store.
It also provides methods for managing the metadata associated with the vectors, such as their IDs and distances.
The VectorStore typeclass is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to implement their own vector stores with custom storage backends and retrieval algorithms.
The VectorStore typeclass is used in conjunction with the Embeddings typeclass to provide a complete solution for managing and retrieving embeddings in Langchain. By implementing the VectorStore typeclass, developers can create custom storage solutions that meet their specific needs and requirements.

## Supported Integrations
At this moment, following integrations available,

- InMemory
- More to come...

## Example 

Below is an example that:
 - Reads a 20 pages long pdf file and generates a list of documents.
 - Sets up an OllamaEmbeddings model.
 - Creates an InMemoryVectoStore with model and documents.
 - Fetches top 2 documents that are closest to the given query.

 ```haskell
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

module VectorStoreExample (runApp) where

import Langchain.DocumentLoader.Core
import Langchain.DocumentLoader.PdfLoader
import Langchain.Embeddings.Ollama
import Langchain.VectorStore.InMemory (fromDocuments)
import Langchain.VectorStore.Core (VectorStore(similaritySearch))

runApp :: IO ()
runApp = do
    let pdf = PdfLoader "/home/user/Documents/TS/langchain/SOP.pdf"
    eDocs <- load pdf
    case eDocs of
        Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error while reading docs: " <> err
        Right docs -> do
            let ollamaEmb =
                    OllamaEmbeddings
                        { model = "nomic-embed-text:latest"
                        , defaultTruncate = Just True
                        , defaultKeepAlive = Just "5m"
                        }
            eInMemVS <- fromDocuments ollamaEmb docs
            case eInMemVS of
                Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error while initiating Vector Store: " <> err
                Right inMemVS -> do
                    eRes <- similaritySearch inMemVS "I am having with accessing the vendor portal. I have been unable to log in to my account." 2
                    print eRes
 ```
