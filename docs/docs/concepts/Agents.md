# Agents 

`Agents` module provides a mechanism to create and manage agents. An agent is a type of chain that can take an action based on the output of a previous action. Agents are useful for building complex workflows that require multiple steps and decision-making.
Agents can be used to create chatbots, recommendation systems, and other applications that require a sequence of actions to be performed based on user input or other data.
Agents are designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to implement their own agents with custom input and output types. The `Agent` typeclass is used in conjunction with the `Chain` typeclass to provide a complete solution for building and executing chains of agents. By implementing the `Agent` typeclass, developers can create custom agents that meet their specific needs and requirements.

As of 0.0.1.0, the agents are in the early stages of development and are not yet fully functional. The API may change in future releases, and additional features may be added as the library evolves. The current implementation is intended for experimentation and exploration of the agent concept, and is not yet suitable for production use.
